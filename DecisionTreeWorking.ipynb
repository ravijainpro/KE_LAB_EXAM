    "    We do this also in a recursive manner. That is, we wander down the tree and check if we have reached a leaf or if we are still in a sub tree. \n",
    "    Since this is a important step to understand, the single steps are extensively commented below.\n",
    "    1.Check for every feature in the query instance if this feature is existing in the tree.keys() for the first call, \n",

    "    return the default value which is the majority value of the target feature\n",

    "    a unseen query it may happen that the feature values of these query are not existing in our tree model because non of the\n",
    "    training instances has had such a value for this specific feature. \n",
    "    For instance imagine the situation where your model has only seen animals with one to four\n",
    "    legs - The \"legs\" node in your model will only have four outgoing branches (from one to four). If you now show your model\n",
    "    a new instance (animal) which has for the legs feature the vale 5, you have to tell your model what to do in such a \n",
    "    situation because otherwise there is no classification possible because in the classification step you try to \n",
    "    run down the outgoing branch with the value 5 but there is no such a branch. Hence: Error and no Classification!\n",
    "    We can address this issue with a classification value of for instance (999) which tells us that there is no classification\n",
    "    possible or we assign the most frequent target feature value of our dataset used to train the model. Or, in for instance \n",
    "    medical application we can return the most worse case - just to make sure... \n",
    "    We can also return the most frequent value of the direct parent node. To make a long story short, we have to tell the model \n",
    "    what to do in this situation.\n",
    "    In our example, since we are dealing with animal species where a false classification is not that critical, we will assign\n",
    "    the value 1 which is the value for the mammal species (for convenience).\n",
    "    3. Address the key in the tree which fits the value for key --> Note that key == the features in the query. \n",
    "    Because we want the tree to predict the value which is hidden under the key value (imagine you have a drawn tree model on \n",
    "    the table in front of you and you have a query instance for which you want to predict the target feature \n",
    "    - What are you doing? - Correct:\n",
    "    You start at the root node and wander down the tree comparing your query to the node values. Hence you want to have the\n",
    "    value which is hidden under the current node. If this is a leaf, perfect, otherwise you wander the tree deeper until you\n",
    "    get to a leaf node. \n",
    "    Though, you want to have this \"something\" [either leaf or sub_tree] which is hidden under the current node\n",
    "    and hence we must address the node in the tree which == the key value from our query instance. \n",
    "    This is done with tree[keys]. Next you want to run down the branch of this node which is equal to the value given \"behind\"\n",
    "    the key value of your query instance e.g. if you find \"legs\" == to tree.keys() that is, for the first run == the root node.\n",
    "    You want to run deeper and therefore you have to address the branch at your node whose value is == to the value behind key.\n",
    "    This is done with query[key] e.g. query[key] == query['legs'] == 0 --> Therewith we run down the branch of the node with the\n",
    "    value 0. Summarized, in this step we want to address the node which is hidden behind a specific branch of the root node (in the first run)\n",
    "    this is done with: result = [key][query[key]]\n",
    "    4. As said in the 2. step, we run down the tree along nodes and branches until we get to a leaf node.\n",
    "    That is, if result = tree[key][query[key]] returns another tree object (we have represented this by a dict object --> \n",
    "    that is if result is a dict object) we know that we have not arrived at a root node and have to run deeper the tree. \n",
    "    Okay... Look at your drawn tree in front of you... what are you doing?...well, you run down the next branch... \n",
    "    exactly as we have done it above with the slight difference that we already have passed a node and therewith \n",
    "    have to run only a fraction of the tree --> You clever guy! That \"fraction of the tree\" is exactly what we have stored\n",
    "    under 'result'.\n",
    "    So we simply call our predict method using the same query instance (we do not have to drop any features from the query\n",
    "    instance since for instance the feature for the root node will not be available in any of the deeper sub_trees and hence \n",
    "    we will simply not find that feature) as well as the \"reduced / sub_tree\" stored in result.\n",
    "    SUMMARIZED: If we have a query instance consisting of values for features, we take this features and check if the \n",
